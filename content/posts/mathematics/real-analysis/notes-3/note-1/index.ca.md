Definition 3.1
A sequence of real numbers (a sequence in R) is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{R}$. 

Definition 3.2
A sequence of real numbers $X = (x_n)$ is convergent if there exists $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $|x_n - x| < \varepsilon$ for all $n > k_\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon > 0$ is arbitary and $k_\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$ depends on $\varepsilon$. The number $x$ is called the limit of $X$ and $X$ is said to converge to $x$. Otherwise, the sequence is divergent.

Theorem 3.1
The limit of a sequence $X = (x_n)$ is unique if it exists.
proof:
Suppose the sequence X has two limits $x$ and $x'$......

Definition 3.5.1  
Cauchy sequence is a sequence of real number $(x_n)$ such that for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N(\varepsilon) \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for any natural numbers $n, m \ge H(\varepsilon)$, $|x_n - x_m| < \varepsilon$.
